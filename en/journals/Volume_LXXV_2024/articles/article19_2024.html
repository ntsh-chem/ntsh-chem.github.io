    <h2>
      RESEARCH ACTIVITY OF SECONDARY EDUCATION STUDENTS IN THE PROCESS OF STUDYING CHEMISTRY

    </h2>
    <p>
      The theoretical-methodological and methodical aspects of the research study and the peculiarities of the
      organization of research activities of pupils at secondary education institutions were analyzed. An ascertaining
      experiment was conducted to check the effectiveness of conducting research activities of students of secondary
      education in the process of studying chemistry.</br>
      An anonymous survey of 100 pupils of 7‒10 classes of Yuriy Verbytskyi secondary school No. 27 of Lviv, and 12
      teachers of secondary education institutions of Halytskyi district of Lviv was performed. The results of this
      experiment were analyzed and summarized: 70.3 % of pupils noticed that they consider chemistry as interesting
      experimental science and like to make investigations; 66 % realize the importance of chemical experiments in
      studying the properties of substances, however, for 20.1 % of pupils is difficult to predict the way of chemical
      reactions based on the properties of substances; 21.6 % of respondents cannot justify the relationship between the
      structure and properties of substances; 53.2 % of pupils can predict the application of substances by their
      properties.</br>
      As evidenced by the survey results, 60 % of pupils perform creative (research) tasks during chemistry lessons, 65
      % conduct experiments at home, 57 % take part in educational projects, and 52.3 % carry out search and analysis of
      information using internet resources. To promote the research activity of pupils in chemistry 78 % of teachers use
      project method, 58 % ‒ individual forms of work, 56 % ‒ work with information resources, 25 % ‒ group work. 41 %
      of teachers believe that the development of pupils’ research skills causes sustained interest in the subject
      study, 25 % are sure that it develops students analytical and critical thinking, 17 % think that it contributes to
      the comprehensive development of the personality and to the improvement and maximum use of their creative
      abilities.
