    <h2>
      PEDAGOGICAL CONDITIONS AS A COMPONENT OF THE SYSTEM OF FORMATION HEALTH CULTURE OF HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENTS 
IN THE STUDY OF CHEMICAL DISCIPLINES 
    </h2>
    <p>
      The relevance of the study of the formation of health culture of higher education students of biological and
      chemical faculties in the study of chemical disciplines is outlined. The formation of a health culture of higher
      education students is considered as a holistic system of cultivating personal and professional qualities in
      students that contribute to the preservation and promotion of health through the comprehension of sustainable
      ideas about health as the highest value, increase motivation to lead a healthy lifestyle, increase responsibility
      for their health and the health of others, and encourage continuous professional growth by updating health
      knowledge.</br>
      An integrated model of the system of health culture formation of higher education students is developed and
      substantiated, the structure of which consists of target, content-methodical and effective blocks. The proposed
      model reflects the purpose, main components, levels and criteria of health culture formation, reveals the
      importance of chemical disciplines for the formation of health culture, pedagogical conditions and approaches to
      the formation of health culture, the main stages and results of experimental work updating health-saving
      knowledge.</br>
      Pedagogical conditions are defined as a set of factors that contribute to the improvement of the organization of
      the educational process aimed at forming a culture of health, the need for a healthy lifestyle, health-saving
      skills, and create an atmosphere of cooperation between the teacher and the student. Important pedagogical
      conditions that ensure the formation of motivational and value, cognitive and content, and practical and activity
      components of the health culture of higher education students in the study of chemical disciplines are the
      creation of a favorable cultural and educational environment, the integration of theoretical and practical
      training of students in the field of health, etc. Methodological recommendations for the formation of a culture of
      health of higher education students in the study of chemical disciplines in higher education institutions have
      been developed.
