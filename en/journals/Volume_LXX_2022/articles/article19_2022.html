    </h2>
    <p>
      The issue of forming the health culture of master's degree students of the Faculty of Chemistry during the study
      of chemical disciplines is considered. The main reasons for studying the formation of students’ health culture as
      a pedagogical problem are outlined. Theoretical and methodological aspects of forming the foundations of students’
      health culture in higher education institutions are analyzed. Criteria, basic principles and conditions of
      formation of bases of culture of health of students, ways of their realization in educational process are proved.
      The study defines the culture of students’ health as a component of general and professional culture, which
      includes values of health, knowledge of one's own body, skillful and rational use of its capabilities,
      environmental awareness, demonstrates student readiness for a healthy lifestyle, desire for self-knowledge.
      self-preservation, development and self-improvement, successful self-realization in personal life and professional
      activity, etc. </br>
      The formation of a culture of students’ health as nurturing in student youth such personal and professional
      qualities that contribute to maintaining and strengthening health through the achievement of sustainable ideas
      about health as the highest value, increase motivation to lead a healthy lifestyle, increase responsibility for
      their health and the health of others, encourage the constant growth of professional competence by updating
      health-preserving knowledge. The results of experimental research are given. An anonymous survey was conducted
      among master’s degree students of the Faculty of Chemistry (39 people), its results were analyzed and summarized.
      The survey showed that 100 % of respondents understand the importance of maintaining their own health. In
      particular, 48.7 % of respondents follow the rules of nutrition, 46.2 % properly organize training and recreation,
      43.6 % of students regularly play sports and follow a daily routine. At the same time, 20.5 % of students do
      nothing to maintain their health. Students' self-assessment of the level of formation of their health culture
      showed a significant increase in this indicator during studies at the Faculty of Chemistry (manifestation of
      sufficient and high levels in students of I and II–IV courses, master's degree was 48.7 %; 74.3 %; 82.1 %).
